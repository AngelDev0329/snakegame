# kflys_snakegame
Built my very own Snake Game using just pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Everyone remembers Snake right?! I decided to get creative and take it a step further to have some fun redesigning it as one of my old favorite movies, Beetlejuice! 

## Deployment 
* Netlify: https://kfly-sandwormgame.netlify.com/ 

## Built With
For this application I built this entirely with the following: 
* [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) 
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
* [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas)

## Author

## Features to Implement in the Future
I plan to find a way to implement a leader board to track players high scores! 80's Arcade style where you enter your 3 initials.
